Schema Networks: Zero-shot Transfer with a Generative Causal Model of Intuitive Physics;
ICML 2017: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04317

### problem
* task-to-task transfer
* to efficiently generalize experience in one scenario to other similar scenarios
* modeling causality: the ability to reason about previous observations and explain away alternative causes.

### idea: Schema Networks
* is an object-oriented generative physics simulator (a structured generative model of an MDP)
  * capable of disentangling multiple causes of events and reasoning backward through causes to achieve goals.
  * for object-oriented reinforcement learning and planning
* incorporate key desiderata for the flexible and compositional transfer of learned prior knowledge to new settings. 
  * Knowledge is represented with “schemas” – local cause-effect relationships involving one or more object entities; 
  * In a new setting, these cause-effect relationships are traversed to guide action selection; and 
  * The representation deals with uncertainty, multiple-causation, and explaining away in a principled way.  
* can learn the dynamics of an environment directly from data
* learning objective for Schema Networks is de signed to understand causality within these environments;
  Instead of learning policies to maximize rewards

### setup
* evaluate the end-to-end system on Break-out variations
* compare against 
  * Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) (Mnih et al., 2016) and 
  * Progres-sive Networks (PNs) (Rusu et al., 2016), which extends A3C explicitly to handle transfer. 
* reporting results on training efficiency and zero-shot generalization,
* The environments considered in this work are conceptually
diverse but also simplified in a number of ways with re-
spect to the real world: states, actions, and rewards are all
discretized as binary random variables; the dynamics of the
environments are deterministic; and there is no uncertainty
in the observed entity states.

### comments
* this work essentially is about learning the dynamics model, which is formulated as supervised learning
  * why there is no report on testing errors? but directly go to evaluating RL
* concepts:
  * the idea of entity templates to structure states
  * object-oriented MDP
