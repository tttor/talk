SGD can directly minimize the risk function
\begin{itemize}
    \item by sampling a point i.i.d from D and
        using a subgradient of the loss of the current hypothesis at this point as
    an unbiased estimate of the (sub)gradient of the risk function.
    \item recall its \textbf{convergence rate} and \textbf{the number of iterations} \\
    that would guarantee an expected objective of at most $\epsilon$ plus the optimal objective.
\end{itemize}
