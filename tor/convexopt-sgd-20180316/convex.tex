In general, a convex learning problem is a problem whose hypothesis class is a
convex set, and whose loss function is a convex function for each example.

Convex-Smooth/Lipschitz-Bounded
problems are learnable.

handle some nonconvex problems
by minimizing “surrogate” loss functions that are convex (instead of the original
nonconvex loss function).
