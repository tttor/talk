In general, a convex learning problem is a problem whose hypothesis class is a
convex set, and whose loss function is a convex function for each example.

Convex-Smooth/Lipschitz-Bounded
problems are learnable.

handle some nonconvex problems
by minimizing “surrogate” loss functions that are convex (instead of the original
nonconvex loss function).

12.1 Convexity, Lipschitzness, and Smoothness

12.1.1 Convexity
definition 12.1 (Convex Set)
fig in p157
definition 12.2 (Convex Function)

An important property of convex functions is that every local minimum of the
function is also a global minimum.
Another important property of convex functions is that for every w we can
construct a tangent to f at w that lies below f everywhere.
