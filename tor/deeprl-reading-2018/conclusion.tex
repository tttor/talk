Limitation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item DDPG requires a large number of training episodes to find solutions
  (as with most model-free reinforcement approaches)
  \item assume fully observability
\end{itemize}

% Deep DPG:
% DPG that uses neural network function approximators to
% learn in large state and action spaces online.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item a model-free, off-policy actor-critic algorithm using deep function approximators
%   \item can learn competitive policies for all of our tasks using low-dimensional observations
%   (e.g. cartesian coordinates or joint angles) using the same hyper-parameters and network structure.
%   \item In many cases, we are also able to learn good policies directly from pixels, again keeping hyperparameters and network structure constant
% \end{itemize}
