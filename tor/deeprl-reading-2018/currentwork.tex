Interests, lack of ideas yet :(
\begin{itemize}
  \item deeply bayesian RL for partially observable MDPs,
  continuous control, interaction of model-based and model-free RL,
  \item real, physics-intensive tasks
\end{itemize}

On going:
\begin{itemize}
  \item playing around with sim timestep, case: grasping
  \item movodemo, case: pickandplace
\end{itemize}

% Nuts and Bolts Task:
% Assumed that the robot has already been trained to recognize, want, grasp, and eat cookies.
% The cookies in this task are within cages, and the cage covers are locked with nuts and bolts.
% The robot must learn to use a wrench and his fingers to remove the cover and get the cookie.
% \end{frame}

% Practical :
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item grasping, using tools,
%   e.g.  Nuts and Bolts Task:
%   \item navigation among movable obstacles
%   (motion planning with minimal collisions)
%   \item (physics) games, e.g
%   car racing, block stacking (simplified Tummple, Jenga)
% \end{itemize}
