\frametitle{Experiment Setup}

\begin{itemize}
  \item 20 simulated physics task,
  including classic problems such as cartpole swing-up, dexterous manipulation, legged locomotion and car driving
  \item non-linear fn approx
  \item a baseline computed by a planner (Tassa et al., 2012) that
  has full access to the underlying simulated dynamics and its derivatives (see supplementary information).
\end{itemize}
