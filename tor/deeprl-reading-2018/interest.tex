Note: too broad, too abstract, too wild,
but let's collaborate!

Theoretical:
\begin{itemize}
  \item continuous control,
  e.g. DDPG
  \item interaction of model-based and model-free RL,
  e.g Dyna-2, (comprehensive) sensitivity analysis:
  \item deeply bayesian RL for partially observable MDPs
\end{itemize}

Practical (real, physics-intensive, human-collaborative-able, fine/dexterous):
\begin{itemize}
  \item grasping, using tools,
  e.g.  Nuts and Bolts Task:
  \item navigation among movable obstacles
  (motion planning with minimal collisions)
  \item (physics) games, e.g
  car racing, block stacking (simplified Tummple, Jenga)
\end{itemize}

Nuts and Bolts Task:
Assumed that the robot has already been trained to recognize, want, grasp, and eat cookies.
The cookies in this task are within cages, and the cage covers are locked with nuts and bolts.
The robot must learn to use a wrench and his fingers to remove the cover and get the cookie.
